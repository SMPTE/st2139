## Details

The USB-C connector is increasingly being used to interconnect devices used in media production. There is a need to be able to interconnect and synchronize such devices with existing professional media equipment. Standards including but not limited to AES 11, SMTPE ST 274, and SMPTE ST 2110-10 define timing reference for analogue signals, digital audio streams, IP datagram networks, MAC bridges, serial data signals, and VLAN-aware bridges. These timing references cannot be directly transported over USB-C data connections without protocol overhead and other latency impacts. This is especially true in cases where highly accurate synchronization is required such as timing for camera shutter, display refresh, and lighting. To solve this problem, a USB-C Alternate Mode is used to enable transport of timing reference pulses between USB-C devices.
